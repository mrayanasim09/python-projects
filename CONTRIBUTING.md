- Enhance the documentation to make it more informative and user-friendly.
- Refactor code to improve readability and maintainability.

### 5. Commit Your Changes

Once you've made your changes, it's time to commit them. Stage the files you want to include in your commit:

```
  git commit -m "Add new GUI project: ProjectName"
```

### 6. Push Your Changes
